title: How we created our website at POP
---

## Goal & Team workers
I collaborate with CEO and front-end developer to built POP 2.0 website. Our goal was to attract more users from Asia (Japan, Taiwan, China), Europe and United States prototype their design through POP and increase the amount of user. So that we could introduce price plan smoothly in the future.


## STEP 1: Discussing the copies
We discussed what the values we want to deliver to our customers first. We discussed in Traditional Chinese on [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lnr6oY6VQziAiUJRdlEp0Kfb7NoTICpFhQ0ftKYvslA/edit) since we are all Taiwanese. I was in charge of writing the copies in Chinese. Then, we reached out professional translators to help us translating to Japanese and English. While discussing the content, we also discussed how we arranged our layouts.


## STEP 2: Sketching wireframes quickly
Before moving on to hi-fi wireframes, we simulated our ideas through sketching. We just wanted to decided the content and the rough layout at this moment.

## STEP 3: Creating Mockups
In this stage, we focused on the visual design. We defined the brand image and video content. Front-end developer also joined us at this moment. We defined how it would response depends on different screen sizes together.

## STEP 4: Development
I didn't write any code since at this time I only had very basic level of HTML/CSS. However, I worked with front-end developer closely, so I learned a lot of knowledge about front-end and responsive design in this project.

## Outcome
I don't remember the real data of the conversion. After launch the website, the amount of our users increased, but we didn't success in making users buy our service after 3 months later.
